## The notorious README

Since you got here, either by Google or by my, the authors, link, you might stumble upon a few things you might not understand. If so feel free to contact me either via an issue or via mail (or other available sources).

### Steps to reproduce the chaos:
#### 1: Download or clone
Download the project and unzip it, or clone it either via HTTPS or SSH from your desired application.

#### 2: Build it
Again, pretty simple, as the title says.



With all that said, have fun, enjoy programming, and as always, stay away from Phyton and Javascript :)
